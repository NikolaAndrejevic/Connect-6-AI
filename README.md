This C file contains a program that plays a game of connect 6 between a human player and a computer AI. The program
was made for a competition and therefore, there are no graphics for the game. Instead, the status of the game is
shown through text.

The AI included in this program won 3rd place in a University of Toronto Engineering programming competiton against 300+ 
contestants. Head to head matches were played by running two programs of this structure simultaneously and having the AIs
act as the other promgram's "human" player.
